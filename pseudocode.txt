Look at spatial patterns and the macroecology 
of marine fishes that are distributed from Alaska to Baja, California.
 First I will download a large data set of marine fishes. 
 Download the data of different temperature, salinity, carbon dioxide, oxygen data from website. 
 Download SAM for spatial analysis to test correlation between environmental variables and spatial distance and graph it in R using a map.  
 Use the model in Heath et al. 2008 to 
 look at the effects of climate change, including temperature change, spatials patterns of adults, include recruitment as a longevity for slow growing fishes for developments, and population structure of many different species across the same ecological range. 
 Also look at fishing efforts from populations that are fished that range from Alaska to Baja California and see if that influences spatial dynamics. 
Project Pseudocode

#Download marine fishes from GBIF
#Download elasmobranchs, and other order names with thousands of species
#import raw data into text file 
#write a for loop that parses the data into catalog #, order, genus, species, latitude, longitude, # of occurrences, year, reference
#Download climate data from NOAA at this website http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/cdomarineinv.cmd?dataset=Marine&shiplist=%20%20all&bintype=10&type=3&datequerytype=RANGE&outform=4&startYear=1990&startMonth=12&startDay=30&startHour=0&endYear=2014&endMonth=12&endDay=30&endHour=0&bins=507
#Parse the NOAA climate data by year, temperature, salinity, depth, wind, carbon dioxide, oxygen , and location
#Download iMAP software in R and make a map 
#Import parsed data into R 
#Map the species that range from Baja, California to Alaska and add color 
#write an R code that specifies everything

# Download the Heath et al. 2008 Spatial analysis in R 
#test different environmental variables on latitude and longitude 
#write a code that can run a spatial analysis ANOVA
#after plotting everything and see 

#How do anthropogenic infuences affect the genetic structure of organisms that have an ecological range from Baja,California to Alaska and look at the differences among species.
